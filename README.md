## Pylox

An interpreter for Lox from [Crafting Interpreters] by [Bob Nystrom].
Pylox is incomplete and not intended to be useful, even as a reference.
It is *learning in progress*. I'm merely translating Java snippets to Python
3.x as I read through the book.

## Lox

[Lox] is a high-level programming language created as a teaching aid.
It has a C-like syntax, dynamic typing, automatic memory management, first
class functions, closures, and class-based object orientation.

The standand library contains a single function: `clock()`
